A repository of 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 10 Haskell implementations of the discrete-calculus-based algorithm to compute the least-degree polynomial interpolation of a function defined on an evenly-spaced set of inputs.
The basic algorithm has quadratic time complexity and linear space complexity in the size of said set of inputs.
