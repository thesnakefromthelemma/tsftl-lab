Consider the following problem (tweeted [\@ChShersh](https://twitter.com/ChShersh) on 2025/06/18 and rephrased by me):

> You have before you a button that each time when pressed manifests a value sampled uniformly at random from between \$0 and \$100,000. The first 9 times you press it, you can either destroy the button and keep the money or destroy the money and keep the button\; after the button is pressed 10 times it self-destructs.
>
> With what strategy do you optimize the expected amount of money with which you walk away?

This is a particularly simple case of the general optimal stopping problem (namely for a discrete stochastic process on finitel ywith IID values )
